# Hair-stylist

This code defines a list of hairstyles and their respective prices, and keeps track of the number of haircuts given in the previous week. It then calculates the average price of a haircut, reduces the price of haircuts by 5, calculates the total revenue generated from haircuts in the previous week, and the average daily revenue. Finally, it creates a list of haircuts that are less than $30.

Comments are provided throughout the code to explain each section.
